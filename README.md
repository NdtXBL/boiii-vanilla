# BOIII Vanilla ☄️

Modified version of the BOIII Ezz client: https://github.com/Ezz-lol/boiii-free

BOIII Ezz Client has a few features that can interfere with the campaign which has been
resolved on this version of the client. It is still cross-platform with other versions of
the BOIII client. Due to the features of the Ezz client making it so you could potentially
tamper with runs, that client will be banned from campaign speedruns. That is the point of
this client, which will be allowed in runs.

**Changes (vs Ezz Client):**
- Disabled the developer console in un-modified environments
- Disabled all external console commands besides "/connect" since it is needed for co-op
- Disabled some of the stats features (unlock all, class slots, etc.) as they crossed over to the campaign unfortunately
- Re-enabled the safehouse countdown feature as it was removed in Ezz. I loved this but it provides an unfair advantage against vanilla BO3.
- Lowered Max FPS back down to 240 (as it was in vanilla BO3) due to the unfair advantage. May add this back but I'll have to see what the community thinks of this.

**Why Use This Over Vanilla BO3?**
- For most people, the BOIII client runs much smoother than BO3 due to the FPS issues associated with the steam update
- If something ever happens to the BO3 or steam servers, this client emulates online services. This means that you can still use online features such as the gunsmith (variants for Any%), swag features (like paintshop, custom emblems, etc.), and joining other players for co-op by using radmin VPN or hamachi
- Much more secure than vanilla BO3
