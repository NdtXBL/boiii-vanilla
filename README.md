# BOIII Vanilla ☄️

Modified version of the BOIII Ezz client: https://github.com/Ezz-lol/boiii-free

BOIII Vanilla is a slightly modified version of the Ezz Client, designed to avoid their features that interfere with the campaign mode. This version ensures compatibility with other BOIII clients while resolving issues related to tampering with campaign speedruns. Unlike the Ezz Client, which is banned from speedruns due to potential exploitation, BOIII Vanilla is permitted for use in campaign runs.

**Changes (vs Ezz Client):**
- Disabled the developer console in un-modified environments
- Disabled all external console commands besides "/connect" since it is needed for co-op
- Disabled some of the stats features (unlock all, class slots, etc.) as they crossed over to the campaign unfortunately
- Re-enabled the safehouse countdown feature as it was removed in Ezz. I loved this but it provides an unfair advantage against vanilla BO3.
- Lowered Max FPS back down to 240 (as it was in vanilla BO3) due to the unfair advantage. May add this back but I'll have to see what the community thinks of this.

**Why Use This Over Vanilla BO3?**
- For most people, the BOIII client runs much smoother than BO3 due to the FPS issues associated with the steam update
- If something ever happens to the BO3 or steam servers, this client emulates online services. This means that you can still use online features such as the gunsmith (variants for Any%), swag features (like paintshop, custom emblems, etc.), and joining other players for co-op by using radmin VPN or hamachi
- Much more secure than vanilla BO3
